📊 Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

🧠 Task Objective
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a well-known dataset using visualization techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data. The notebook walks through the process of:
Loading the dataset
Understanding the structure and summary statistics
Creating visualizations to reveal correlations between features

📁 Dataset Used
Dataset: Iris Dataset
Format: CSV (Iris.csv)
Description: Contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) with four features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)

🤖 Models Applied
No machine learning models were applied in this notebook. The focus is purely on exploratory data analysis and visualization.

📌 Key Results and Findings
The scatter plot of Sepal Length vs Petal Length indicates a positive correlation between the two.
Summary statistics and .info() output reveal the dataset is clean with no missing values.
Each class of the Iris species shows distinguishable patterns in the scatterplots, which suggests strong class separability based on the given features.
